# AstroGAN
Generating galaxies with controlled morphologies using GANs.

The idea is to take a morphological feature and restrict the generation to that morphology.
Below are some examples from two datasets. For each example, the row on the far left is a
real image from a held out test set, and the remaining columns are the generated images.
Each row corresponds to the same morphological feature.
